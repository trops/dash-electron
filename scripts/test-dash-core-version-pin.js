/**
 * Regression-pin: dash-electron's `@trops/dash-core` dependency must
 * be at ≥ 0.1.451, the version that removed the End Session button
 * from ChatCore.
 *
 * Why a regression-pin: the End Session removal lives in dash-core
 * (shipped as v0.1.451). dash-electron's only role is to consume
 * that version. If the pin is downgraded, the button silently comes
 * back. This test prevents that. Per the protocol memory's narrow
 * regression-pin exception, this test pattern is approved for
 * regression-pin use here (asserts a specific version pin in
 * package.json, cites the behavior pinned).
 *
 * Pure JSON read + version compare — no jsdom, no React.
