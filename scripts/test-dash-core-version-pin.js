/**
 * Regression-pin: dash-electron's `@trops/dash-core` dependency must
 * be at ≥ 0.1.458, the version that scopes AI widget placement events
 * to the originating workspace. An older version is missing the
 * workspace-id guard in LayoutBuilder, which let a widget built for
 * Dashboard A's cell silently appear in (or overwrite a cell of)
 * Dashboard B when both were open in tabs.
 *
 * Also covers prior pins (≥ 0.1.457 search + 4-pill class filter on
 * Providers sidebar; ≥ 0.1.456 list-item click dismisses class
 * chooser; ≥ 0.1.455 consistent ← Back button; ≥ 0.1.454
 * NewProviderPicker class chooser; ≥ 0.1.453 friendlier
 * WidgetErrorBoundary; ≥ 0.1.452 deep-link create-provider;
 * ≥ 0.1.451 End Session removal) because semver.
 *
 * Why a regression-pin: the End Session removal lives in dash-core
 * (shipped as v0.1.451). dash-electron's only role is to consume
 * that version. If the pin is downgraded, the button silently comes
 * back. This test prevents that. Per the protocol memory's narrow
 * regression-pin exception, this test pattern is approved for
 * regression-pin use here (asserts a specific version pin in
 * package.json, cites the behavior pinned).
 *
 * Pure JSON read + version compare — no jsdom, no React.
